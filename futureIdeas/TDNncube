<h1>Total Domination Number of the n-cube</h1>

<h2>Inspired by:</h2>

<p> It's known for n <= 10. Naively, I think I could do better. I spent a weekend recently look into it 
and I think at the very least I could devise an algorithm that finds a total dominating set for the n-cube quickly. 
I have 0 evidence this is possible. Most of my observations about the total dominating set were just 
restatements of the original problem. But I think a viable plan of attack would be generated all of the possible 
dominating sets for 1<=n<=7 (8, 9, and 10 are just too big) and thinking about what the sets have in common or do not. 
I probably have more to say about what I know about the problem thus far.</p>

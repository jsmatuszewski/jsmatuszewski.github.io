<h1>Finish A Hyperbolic Lampshade I Started</h1>

<h2>Inspired by:</h2>

<p> I have very strong feelings about lighting. I generally don't like overhead lights and absolutely loathe 
white flourescent lighting. I've always liked the idea of turning a knit hyperbolic plane into a lampshade. I never took to 
knitting so I started crocheting one. However, I can't figure out how to crochet a second row, so for now the 
lampshade is one long stitch. </p>

<p>My ceiling light and I patiently await a constantly negatively curved lampshade:</p>

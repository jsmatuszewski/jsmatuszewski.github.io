<h1>Book of Math Spells</h1>

<h2>Inspired by:</h2>

<p> I've explained my desire for more narrative math pieces in _____. This idea is very much related. 
  I've spent a lot of time reflecting on where my interest in math comes from and I think it's a byproduct of hypervigilance. 
  When faced with decisions or trouble, big or small, I spent a lot of time systemizing the situation at hand. I tried to 
  find structure amongst groups of people especially. To be clear none of this was conscious so much as it was a 
  natural mode of thought for me. Eventually I began to recognize similarities within these "structures" and/or 
  the behavior of people within these "structures." I think this is why learning about groups and morphisms felt validating in a sense.
  I hope this didn't sound too sociopathic. 
</p>

<p> Anyway, I think math feels sort of like magic. So that coupled with my bend for seeing math in people makes for a spellbook.

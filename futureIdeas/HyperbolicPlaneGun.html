<h1>Hyperbolic Plane Gun</h1>

<h2>Inspired by: <a href="https://theiff.org/images/IFF_PolyhedralAnnular.pdf">instructions I used to make the model manually and the strife that ensued.</a> </h2>

<p> I want to design what is essentially a packing tape dispenser that can be used to create a polygonal hyperbolic plane.</p>

<p> Sort of limited as far as use cases go. In order to make the "gun" you'd replace the roll of tape with a roll of paper and 
add a mechanism to crease the paper. 
If we're going for gold, there's a mechanism to tape the strip you've made to existing strips in your model.</p>

<h1>Adversial Complexes</h1>

<h2>!!! Idea is under construction !!!</h2>

<p> I want to captrue the structure of (at least) two opposing entities sharing the same physical space. 
    I want to use something Čech/Vietoris-Ripsy for each set of points. But the construction would not result in a filtration, 
    because I want to specify rules for deleting simplexes as the filtration paramater grows. I'll explain with an example but be warned, 
    this idea was not born from a compelling use-case. </p>

<p> Example 1: Zombie Apocalypse*</p>
<p> This apocalypse is realistic in the sense that the zombifying-virus is psychological in nature not physiological. 
    The long awaited zombie appocalypse is in full swing. Zombies and normies (non-zombies) both have outposts for communicating. 
    We could compute the persistent homology (with max dimension = 2) on the geospatial points corresponding to only normies
    to get some sense of the "coverage" of their outposts. We could do the same for the Zombies. Sidenote: a Čech complex maybe 
    makes the most sense here if belonging to a common simplex means direct communication between any 2 outposts is possible. 
    Instead of doing the standard complication (the act of turning points into complexes) we delete an outpost (0-simplex) from the 
    normies network when a zombie outpost is within distance 2r. Maybe because at this value r the deleted outpost is no longer trustworthy. </p>

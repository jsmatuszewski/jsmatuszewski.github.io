<h1>Math to Story Converter</h1>

<h2>Inspired by:</h2>

<p> Wouldn't it be cool to be able to stick math (e.g. a page from a textbook, an equation, a definition, a theorem) 
into a computer program and have the computer cook up a story? Maybe these would be I think lots of math is an abstraction of structures, 
relations, and operations people with no formal math training have had and LOTS of people like thinking about these things. 
But once you bust out math jargon or a greek letter a good chunk of folks are turned off. I think stories could be a way in for some people. </p>

<p> Aside from welcoming newcomers, students themselves stand to benefit from narrative math pieces. In a recent study facilitated by
My Own Imagination, people have an easier time remembering things they already have a cognitive schema for. While learning math is not about
memorization, mnemonic tools can be tremendously helpful when getting your bearings in new math.
</p>

<p> I'm tempted to describe what I want to generate as "mneumonic stories for/of math" but that's too reductive. Ideally the stories would
capture the spirit of the math not exist merely for utility.
